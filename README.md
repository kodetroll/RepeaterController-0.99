This is an Arduino sketch that will implement a rather sketchy (see what I 
did there?) minimalist repeater controller using a simple interface (such 
as a sound card interface). It will keep track of ID time and generate a 
CWID of the specified callsign. Can be configured for negative or positive 
logic input and output. See the readme.txt for more details.
